Admin Dashboard 
This project is designed to retrieve data from an API and present it on an admin dashboard. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the code fetches data dynamically and displays it in the form of a table within the Admin Dashboard. Users have the functionality to update, delete, and search individual rows. Additionally, the application supports bulk deletion of selected rows, providing a comprehensive toolset for managing and interacting with the displayed data.
